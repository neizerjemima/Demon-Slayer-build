            <h3>Kyojuro - Flame Hashira </h3>
            <p class="alignment">As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Kyojuro was a very powerful and skilled combatant. Before he took his father's place,
                Kyojuro was already shown to be an amazing fighter. He successfully avenged the death of the 9 Demon Slayers that died to the
                Flute Demon by himself and later managed to singlehandedly defeat Lower Rank Two, Hairo, who even appraised his swordsmanship
                before he died.
                <br><br>Kyojuro fighting on equal ground with Upper Rank Three, Akaza. As another testament to his strength, even demons as strong
                as Upper Rank Three, Akaza and the fourth-strongest of the known demons, acknowledged and praised Kyojuro's strength. He even 
                went as far as to offer to turn him into a demon so he could surpass his human limits and become stronger, something he only 
                offered to swordsmen whose abilities he believed were refined to their utmost. Akaza also complimented his fighting spirit and
                stated that it was getting close to the "Realm of the Highest," which implied that he was incredibly close to obtaining the 
                Transparent World and the Selfless State.</p>

            <h3>Tanjiro  </h3>
            <p class="alignment">Tanjiro is very kind by nature and has been described by others as having very gentle eyes and a compassionate persona. He exhibits a great deal of determination and will not give up once he has a goal to achieve; the best example of this being his relentless quest to find a cure for Nezuko. Even though he is relatively strong on his own, Tanjiro isn't opposed to asking others for help when he needs it. <br><br>He is very protective of his friends and even more so of his younger sister. However, despite his kind and understanding nature, Tanjiro does have a limit to his tolerance and has a distaste for rudeness and cowardice as he easily becomes annoyed by Zenitsu Agatsuma's constant whining, and angered by Inosuke Hashibira's barbaric actions. Under Tanjiro's rather kind and friendly shell, is a person with a growing fire of rage and vengeance inside of them. This side of him leaks out when Tanjiro first confronts Muzan, ready to take out his sword and attack him. When Muzan escapes, Tanjiro releases his frustration and declares he will be the one to kill Muzan. </p>

            <h3>Nezuko</h3>
            <p class="alignment">Nezuko's original personality as a human was that of a kind and caring girl who thought of others before herself much like her older brother, Tanjiro. Additionally, she was a responsible elder sister to her younger siblings and often put their needs first rather than her own. Nezuko is, however, not afraid to get in harm's way, protecting her friends from demons even after being returned to a human state. It is also shown that Nezuko's humane, laid-back demeanor supports this fact after Tanjiro apologized to her. Nezuko's friendly disposition. While Nezuko initially starts off like any other demon, bloodthirsty and hungry for human flesh, after seeing her brotherâ€™s desire to protect her from being killed by a Demon Slayer despite her being a demon, she changes completely and becomes fiercely protective of him. Unlike most demons who fully remember their human life, Nezuko seems to have forgotten a good portion of her memories as a human, besides those related to her family, and thus doesn't retain the exact personality she had before transformation, instead acting akin of a child. She is still very caring and protective towards humans. </p>

            <h3>Inosuke  </h3>
            <p class="alignment">Inosuke is an extremely short-tempered and proud young man who always likes to think he is the strongest fighter in a situation, constantly challenging most people he comes across and wanting others to respect and praise him for his skill. This often leads him into unnecessary danger, since he tends to overestimate his abilities in comparison to who he's fighting and refuses to accept when he's been defeated, which can be seen when Giyu Tomioka has to tie him up after his fight with the Father Spider Demon to prevent him challenging the Hashira to a fight while still severely injured from his previous battle.<br><br> This constant wanting to be the best can also cause Inosuke to be very provocative, as he often tries to goad others, most prominently Tanjiro Kamado, into fighting him, although in the case of the latter he usually fails due to Tanjiro's obliviously kind nature. Inosuke's anger towards Doma. Inosuke possesses a rather vengeful side to his personality, especially when the people he cares about get harmed. He immediately attacked Doma upon learning he killed and devoured Shinobu and he became truly angered when he found out Doma was also the one who orphaned him.</p>

            <h3>Zenitsu </h3>
            <p class="alignment">Zenitsu comes off as a coward, as he often claims that he doesn't have long to live due to the dangerous job of being a Demon Slayer. He also has rather low self-esteem despite his strength, even considering himself useless as seen when he couldn't believe he had slain a demon and tricked himself into instead believing that it was Shoichi, even though the latter was a young child who didn't possess any form of special demon-slaying ability.<br><br> Zenitsu is in a constant state of fear and always cries and tries to run away at the sight of danger, claiming he wants to live a modest, normal life, instead of that of a Demon Slayer. Due to this, Zenitsu screams and shouts a lot, sometimes annoying the people around him. He is also shown to be pessimistic at times, especially during the Hashira Training Arc where he lashed out at Tanjiro and Inosuke for viewing the training positively. However, despite these weaknesses, Zenitsu still wants to live up to the expectations others set up for him and will try his hardest when he needs to. He holds great respect and admiration towards his comrades and his deceased teacher</p>

            <h3>Akaza - Upper Rank Three </h3>
            <p class="alignment">Akaza is a strong, stubborn and battle-crazed Social Darwinist who enjoys fighting, especially against strong Demon Slayers. Akaza looked down on anybody he deemed weak, so much so that his skin would crawl at the sight of them. However, he genuinely respected those who were strong in his eyes, demanding to know their names, and would not stop until he finds out; he remembers all the names he's committed to memory as tribute to their strength. <br><br>Akaza also presents an opportunity for those he recognizes the strength of to become demons, believing that preserving their refined techniques and skill was right and feels pain watching the deterioration of those blessed with extraordinary gifts as they age, and going so far as to kill them in order to preserve their magnificent skill himself should they decline his offer to become a demon. Akaza also doesn't discriminate strong warriors that were weak before, as shown when he praised and complimented Tanjiro Kamado despite knowing how weak he was during their first encounter, even going so far as to thank Kyojuro for Tanjiro's growth.</p>

            <h3>Kokushibo - Upper Rank One </h3>
            <p class="alignment">Kokushibo is reserved, silent, and aloof, maintaining an aura of unnerving tranquillity and mystery that compliments his position as Upper Rank One. He rarely speaks; when he does, he talks in a slow and emphatic sense that gives more gravitas and authority to his words. He is an adamant rule-follower, punctual, and he shows a great deal of respect to the hierarchy of the Twelve Kizuki, as seen at the Upper Rank gathering.<br><br>Kokushibo is shown to be humble as well, and he did not hesitate to admit his failure or complain of any difficulty. Kokushibo coldly admonishing Akaza. Despite exhibiting outward reservation, dignity, and humility, there is a cold and unforgiving side to his personality; his words can be extremely harsh, especially when reprimanding individuals. His threats come off as nothing short of cruel and overwhelmingly serious, and he demands absolute obedience.Kokushibo is shown to be genuinely delighted when the opponents he faced challenged him; such as helping dress Muichiro Tokito's amputated hand over his talented swordsmanship. </p>

            <h3>Daki - Upper Rank Six</h3>
            <p class="alignment">Daki was a very prideful, dismissive, and sadistic person, taking enjoyment in toying with her victims before killing them and not showing the slightest bit of guilt or remorse for apathetically taking the lives of people. Daki also seemed to think very highly of herself, dismissing all non-Hashira Demon Slayers as not worth her time, and getting incensed when Tanjiro Kamado spoke to her, presumably because she looked down on him. <br><br>This is also shown when Daki said that she might spare Tanjiro if he told her how many Demon Slayers are present in the Entertainment District, and when Daki openly expresses how slow the Demon Slayer's techniques are and her boredom,further exampling her arrogant and dismissive personality. Daki was a very prideful, dismissive, and sadistic person, taking enjoyment in toying with her victims before killing them and not showing the slightest bit of guilt or remorse for apathetically taking the lives of people.

            <h3>Susamaru - Temari Demon</h3>
            <p class="alignment">Susamaru was shown to be rather playful, yet very brash and quite immature while almost always smiling and always enjoys and accepts a challenge. Her pet phrase is "what fun this is" and she will repeat this constantly if engaged in bouts she deems amusing. Her immaturity is a stark contrast to Yahaba's seriousness.She was fanatically loyal to Muzan and battled to her best ability in the hope of killing Tanjiro and taking Tamayo hostage for her master.<br><br>When the latter had denounced Muzan as a manipulative coward, she defended his honour and denied her statements vehemently.In her final moments, it is revealed that Susamaru was really just a girl pushed by the Demon Progenitor with the false notion of being a Twelve Kizuki, and her act of calling out to Tanjiro to play with her last temari caused him to lament her manipulation and blind devotion just to die brutally in the end.</p>

            <h3>Muzan - Demon King </h3>
            <p class="alignment">Muzan is cold-hearted, ruthless, intimidating, and exceptionally intelligent. He sees no value in any humans he has encountered and shows little value in his own subordinates. Rarely ever visually upset or happy, he appears completely monotone and detached on most occasions, even when he callously murders his own subordinates. The only times he ever shows emotion are when his vision of perfection is moving forward or when he has subordinates completely submit to his will. <br><br>The anime shows him to be more expressive, particularly when enraged and his facial features are exaggerated to demonstrate as such (possibly as a way to display his normally unreadable emotions). In the anime, his expressions change slightly and his tone of voice tends to be consistent at nearly all times, accentuating his monotonous demeanor. His cruel and imposing nature has gained him the great admiration and fear of many demons. When he confronts Kagaya Ubuyashiki, the man responded to Muzan in a tone of pity and sadness for the life he had lead. However, Muzan only interpreted it as insults and threats, which further accentuates his hatred for humanity and the Demon Slayers.</p>
